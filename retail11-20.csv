That company is TJ Nowak Supply.

   Our company has several divisions each designed to allow our customers to enjoy multiple services provided by one supply partner. The business was opened in 1954 providing welding technology and hard goods. As that business grew industrial shield gasses and welding accessories were added to the companies' offerings.  In the early 60's the fire protection group was formed, followed by the barricade and Jon rental business, (1970), safety and first aid groups, (1980), fire gear and equipment for first responders, (1985), wholesale balloon and gasses group, (1987), retail party products, (1992), and several acquisitions since then. In each since then. In each of these disciplines we enjoy the knowledge, not by our own definition but by that of our customers that we continue to meet or exceed their needs day in and out.

As a gold and silver dealer, CMIGS' mission is to guide and direct investors into the precious metal that best fits their investment goals, while offering the lowest prices available. This includes advising investors as to which precious metal, in CMIGS' analysis, holds the greatest upside potential. We also consider it our responsibility to warn investors to avoid telemarketer-promoted gold and silver coins that are grossly overpriced. 

CMIGS also has as its mission the education of precious metals investors as to the benefits–and dangers–of the precious metals markets. We do this through this website and Bill's Blog, on which Bill Haynes, CMIGS' president, writes about economic, political and social developments that affect precious metals prices.

Our Promise:

We will recommend only those precious metals investments that we believe will provide you the biggest profits, not the ones that provide us the biggest profits. We also recognize that many people buy precious metals not for ""profits"" but for ""insurance."" In such cases, we recommend the precious metal that we believe will meet those goals.",Arizona,3800 N Central Ave,"AddThis, Amazon AWS, Bootstrap Framework, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Google Cloud Hosting, Google Font API, Google Tag Manager, Hotjar, Mobile Friendly, Nginx, Outlook, Phoenix, Remote, Route 53, WordPress.org",,,https://twitter.com/cmigoldsilver,http://www.cmi-gold-silver.com,wnh1@cox.net,https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2,c_suite,Arizona,President/CEO,

Sign up for a FREE account and check out our vast selection of over 1200+ import and domestic toys.","A Little About Us:
Our roots start from a small annexed backroom in San Gabriel, California (USA). We started out originally as a B2B company providing local retailers with import titles. Within a year, we relocated to a 1,000 square foot retail front serving the heart of San Gabriel Valley. It was during these golden years that we specialized in all import games/hardware.

By 2010, we have relocated to a 10,000 sq. foot facility just a few miles south of Old Town Pasadena.

Today, we have grown to distribute not only import video games, but also an extremely robust line of licensed toy merchandise from world-famous brands. With deep vendor relationships throughout the world, we are able to globally deliver and distribute within time and under budget to our wholesale clients and direct end-consumers.

With a combined total of over 50 years of retail and distribution experience, we are continuously scouting the world over for the most popular and innovative products available. We are your direct source for import toys and games.

Who We Are:
We care about your sales as much as you do. Our business is truly run like a family and we treat our clients like family too. If you buy too much of the wrong item, we'll stop you and tell you to spend your money where it might be more fruitful. 

If you buy too little when you should be buying more, we'll ask you to buy more so you can take advantage of a season/lifestyle of a product. We are not interested in selling you items that aren't a fit for your store. After all, we want you to be lifetime clients.

What We Will Do For You:
What has excited us is that we've learned that we're in the business of helping you create the most beautiful and desirable toy environments that deliver unbelievable amounts of happiness to your clients.",California,1509 W Valley Blvd,"AI, Android, Basis, Flutter, Gmail, Google Apps, IoT, Mobile Friendly, Python, Remote, Render, SharePoint, Shopify",,,https://twitter.com/japanvideogames,http://www.thejbkinternational.com,powergamer88@gmail.com,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQH_Lo0oCqazjw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1710271672997?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=DeQCriCdSgBuDDC59bS6Mg4juOgwWUuh2z4IRbhxME0,c_suite,California,CEO at JBK International,

Some will say that BROKERS SUCK!!!!!

This is not a grocery industry wide opinion, but it is something we hear from time to time. Often, it's more subtle. X charges too much, why add the extra expense? I did all the work anyway, they don't do much….

People that say this often need a broker the most. 😀

We could go on and on. We have not dealt with this too much personally, but it is something we have to be aware of.

So, how is SMB Sales & Marketing different? Spoiler alert, pragmatically, we're not. We perform the same functions as other brokers.

Why go with us then?

We bring the passion!
Using knowledge, hustle & adaptability to get you on shelf. Because all we care about is getting you on shelf.

We do want to work for you! We don't want to kill you with fees. We want to be honest about the challenges you will face. We want to be in it with you!

We won't succeed unless you succeed!

We can be a broker like the others while ALSO being your best fit! The difference is the passion to sell!

We are steeped in irony and camp, a conversation starter, a historical nod, and a forward-looking brand in the evolving cannabis culture.

- Our ambition is to leverage the Reefer Madness brand's legacy as a satirical critique of anti-drug hysteria into an instantly recognizable branding and retail opportunity.
- We aim to tap into the massive total addressable cannabis market, turning this iconic brand into a valuable licensing opportunity for partners in the cannabis industry and beyond, including complementary consumer packaged goods (CPG) categories.
- We are committed to utilizing the elements of camp, satire, and irony inherent to the Reefer Madness franchise to connect with and speak to those who passionately oppose the ongoing drug war and today's propagandist movements that perpetuate similar harm.

Partnering with Reefer Madness means aligning with a compelling and culturally influential brand. We provide a unique branding and retail opportunity, appealing to cannabis enthusiasts as well as those who appreciate the art, satire, and social commentary.

Pinkyotto is the brainchild of Ryo Liu, a former model and MFA graduate from Pratt Institute, and Peter Hsia who hails from the fast-paced world of finance and graduated from NYU's Stern School of Business. Noticing a void for edgy, yet elegant fashion at an affordable price point, presented by way of knowledgeable and approachable sales associates, Ryo envisioned a fun-filled, charming place for stylish girls to turn to for all of their wardrobe necessities.

Ryo's ""a-ha!"" moment arose when she decided that Pinkyotto would become a recreation of her best friend's closet; a space filled with a selection of distinct and uniquely cut, vintage-inspired pieces with bold, artistic prints. Peter makes sure these fashions of fancy don't break the bank. Together, they make Pinkyotto an attainable luxury.

A dichotomous edit, Pinkyotto offers a little something for everyone—from ultra-feminine daytime wear to pieces fit for the most daring of night vixens.

Twenty-five years ago, two avid rock climbers with a knack for invention saw a need for advancement in climbing equipment technology. They put their heads together and began to make their designs a reality.

In 1998, these climbers realized that their spring-loaded anchors were in demand well beyond the mountains. Much larger fields with extensive safety concerns such as the construction, industrial, military and mining industries were plagued by outdated, heavy, and cumbersome equipment. Thus, ClimbTech was founded.

Today, ClimbTech's innovative anchor solutions have achieved a global reputation for dependability. And with contractors and climbers alike sharing success stories made possible by ClimbTech products, ClimbTech continues to grow.

In today's society where our clothes often reflect our individuality, we should cherish the ability to stand apart from the crowd in the CockpitTM USA collection. Our passion is to preserve the heritage of American life styles and take pride in reminiscing about the classic iconic eras of American fashion.

Description
From the Founders of Avirex LTD. was born Cockpit USA. The first to bring Vintage and contemporary Aviation/ Military inspired apparel back into fashion starting in the mid 1970's. It has evolved from military influence to include classic american heritage styles and symbolize the rugged yet stylish fashions of American Culture. Since that time there have been many imitators but there is only one original. Working closely with the USAF we helped bring back the A-2 Flight Jacket into military use in 1987, have supplied Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard Units, as well as many foreign Militaries. We have been fan favorites of Civilian Pilots, Air Show Performers, Military Pilots, Movie Stars, Sports Stars, and the function and fashion conscious who look for high quality outerwear, predominantly made in the USA. We strive to produce a quality garment that can last years and be passed down generations.",New York,15 West 39th Street,"Adobe Media Optimizer, Afterpay, Backbone JS Library, Bing Ads, Cedexis Radar, Criteo, Facebook Conversion Tracking, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Google Analytics, Google Font API, Google Tag Manager, Gorgias, Mailchimp Mandrill, Microsoft Office 365, Mobile Friendly, Outlook, Render, Shopify, Shopify Plus, Vimeo, Yotpo, YouTube, accessiBe, reCAPTCHA",,,https://twitter.com/CockpitUSAinc,http://www.cockpitusa.com,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5603AQG7O7hRvdyqlA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1517573928749?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=SxZjwS4Zg7z3N3CwHeprhol5qfBU2N_cNbJt0-qiYTc,founder,New York,Founder,

Pure Inventions is the shared and enduring passion of lifelong friends Lynne Gerhards and Lori Mulligan. As Clinical Certified Nutritionists, they've always championed healthy hydration and natural wellness choices. But they noticed that for a lot of their busy clients, this was easier said than done. 

In 2003, they set out to change that by launching Pure Inventions, a revolutionary line of water infusion drops enhanced with extracts from nature's most powerful wellness and beauty ingredients. With natural electrolytes, antioxidants, and key nutrients, the delicious flavors won't be the only thing your body craves from our drops. We pride ourselves in creating a product free of sugar, calories, and artificial sweeteners to fit the lifestyles of everyone.

Great taste. Great convenience. Great benefits. Enjoy the mind and body support that only nature can provide.

1917 – As America was at war and food supplies rationed, seafood loving Seattleites were faced with a fish shortage of epic proportions. Enterprising businessmen, hoping to make a large profit on the meager supply, took advantage of the situation by inflating prices well beyond what average shoppers could afford. Citizens were outraged. Sensing a crisis, then Washington State Governor Ernest Lister stepped in, insisting on a plan to guarantee that a state controlled supply of fish be delivered by the City of Seattle to consumers at the lowest possible price. He asked that the Fisheries Commission turn over to the Seattle city government dead hatchery salmon that were killed for their eggs and sperm. On January 14, 1917, an emergency ordinance was introduced to the Seattle City Council by Washington State Fish Commissioner L.H. Darwin requesting that money be set aside from the general budget to establish, maintain and operate a city owned fish market.

On January 25th 1918, the Municipal Fish Market opened in one of the original stalls on Pike Place. Immediately, throngs of consumers swooped down on the business, buying their three and half pound limit of fish and oysters at a third of the previous cost. In fact, that first day over 1,391 pounds of salmon alone were sold to hungry Seattleites. The Municipal Fish Market was a hit!

In 1923, the city elected to get out of the fish business and leased the market to a private owner. Rechristened City Fish, Seattle's original seafood company stood at the entrance to Pike Place Market, offering a full line of fresh seafood at a fair price, now direct from the fisherman to the consumer.

One hundred years later, Seattle's original seafood company, City Fish Seafood Market, still stands in its original location in the heart of the Pike Place Market. Come by, take a photo and shop our wide selection of fisherman-direct fresh seafood at fair prices.",Washington,1535 Pike Pl,"Android, Cloudflare DNS, Constant Contact, DoubleClick, DoubleClick Conversion, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Flutter, Gmail, Google Analytics, Google Apps, Google Dynamic Remarketing, Google Tag Manager, IoT, Klaviyo, Mobile Friendly, Python, Remote, SharePoint, Shopify, Typekit, Woo Commerce, WordPress.org, reCAPTCHA",,,https://twitter.com/CityFishSeattle,http://www.cityfish.com,,https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2,owner,Washington,Owner,

Frustrated with expensive and wasteful decisions every time his favorite shades scratched, he was the first to ask co-founders, Brandon Dill and Jon Martino, ""Can't I just replace the lenses in my sunglasses?"" 

At the time, they already had extensive experience working in prescription optical labs and quickly dove into the world of ""plano"" lens technology. And it would never be the same.  
 
At the start, only low-quality, thin, and wavy lenses were available, what most would consider ""gas station lenses."" They set out, working alongside some of the top lens manufacturers to create something better. 
 
Today, every pair of Fuse Lenses is made of ""better-than-brand-name,"" shatterproof Polycarbonate that is 3x more durable and backed by a 60-day guarantee and lifetime warranty. Fuse Lenses is also the only place to get a true color-enhancing lens that is made for any brand name sunglasses. And it's not over yet.  

From the very beginning, every lens cut, new product introduced, and innovation made is driven by the voice of our customers, our ""Fuse Squad.""

Many of our items are simple in function, others are practically ingenious, but each and every one of them has a distinct purpose aimed at making your everyday life a little more convenient.

Internally, Houseables is a veritable melting pot of unique and hilarious individuals. Our massive workforce of fourteen people (plus a team of seven in China) may not sound like a lot, but we all perform many different functions for the company. We play to our strengths and we strive to learn as much as we can, improving our skill sets along the way. There are no weak links; just sharp-minded, very cool people from all walks of life with unique interests, passions, style, and personality. More often than not, laughter can be heard resonating throughout the walls of our office and warehouse spaces. It's a little contagious, really.

A lot of young start-ups might delve into the adage of ""work hard, play hard,"" but we cannot think of another place that believes in that philosophy more than Houseables. The perks of working here are pretty solid. Weekends off, paid holidays off, birthdays off, flexible vacation time and sick days, and a generous health care package. We have monthly team outings, plenty of free meals and holiday potlucks. We love the holidays most of all and we love having any excuse to celebrate them.

Throughout the past few years, we've upgraded everything we sell, expanded our presence online into different countries, and expanded to a bigger location to better suit our needs.

Since our founding in 1937 our focus has remained on customer service. As a multi-generation family business, we strive to maintain and improve the service we provide our customers. The story of today's Master Pontiac Buick GMC began in 1926 when a young Walter Schlapp arrived in Augusta from Germany to take a job arranged for him by a U.S. citizen who spent his summers in Germany. The 20-yea...r-old Schlapp was a trained metal worker but gladly accepted the job with an ice and coal business to avoid a crushing economic depression in Germany.


William Schafer, Schlapp's best friend has also realized the seriousness of the German depression and joined Schlapp in the ice and coal business using his skills as a bookkeeper. Both men intended to return to Germany to remain; however, time and fate intervened and in 1930 the two best friends married sisters and honeymooned on an ocean liner - back to the U.S. and their old jobs at the ice and coal business in Augusta.",South Carolina,3625 Richland Ave W,"AI, ASP.NET, Adobe Coldfusion, Amazon AWS, Bing Ads, Bootstrap Framework, DoubleClick, DoubleClick Conversion, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Google AdWords Conversion, Google Analytics, Google Dynamic Remarketing, Google Font API, Google Maps, Google Tag Manager, Lotame, Microsoft Azure Hosting, Microsoft-IIS, Mobile Friendly, Outlook, Render, The Trade Desk, YouTube, reCAPTCHA",,,https://twitter.com/MasterChevrolet,http://www.masterchevrolet.com,,https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2,owner,Georgia,Owner,

Shortly after moving to Virginia and working as a master tailor at Berry Burke and Thalhimers, Franco founded Franco's Fine Clothier in historic Lakeside.  Initially known as a purveyor of high-quality suits with precision tailoring by in-house tailors, Franco's quickly expanded its range of menswear to include tailored clothing, sportswear, formalwear, footwear, and a wide assortment of fine furnishings for men.

From the perfect outfit to the perfect gift, we are here to make each moment unforgettable.

In December 2018 I graduated from Clemson University with a BA in Communication and a minor in Business Administration. Since high school, I have had a passion for boutiques and small chain retail. After managing Razzberry Fizz for several months, I knew that this is what I was made to do for a living. When the opportunity to own a boutique presented itself, the answer seemed so clear.. YES! But there are so many risks in owning a business. I've always been a risk taker, but never had to make a life decision of this magnitude. This meant dedicating myself and my life to this boutique, with no option to change my mind- as I frequently do. Prayers, tears, fear, but mostly excitement! I began to have a vision for this local spot and saw so much potential not only for the store but also in myself. On October 23, 2019, risk = taken. I am so excited to share this journey with y'all and can't wait for The Fizz Boutique to become a Clemson staple and your go-to hometown boutique.",South Carolina,104 Keith St,"AI, Android, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Flutter, Gmail, Google Analytics, Google Apps, Google Tag Manager, IoT, Mobile Friendly, Python, Remote, SharePoint, Shopify, Vimeo",,,,http://www.thefizzboutique.com,,https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2,owner,South Carolina,Owner,

In today's society where our clothes often reflect our individuality, we should cherish the ability to stand apart from the crowd in the CockpitTM USA collection. Our passion is to preserve the heritage of American life styles and take pride in reminiscing about the classic iconic eras of American fashion.

Description
From the Founders of Avirex LTD. was born Cockpit USA. The first to bring Vintage and contemporary Aviation/ Military inspired apparel back into fashion starting in the mid 1970's. It has evolved from military influence to include classic american heritage styles and symbolize the rugged yet stylish fashions of American Culture. Since that time there have been many imitators but there is only one original. Working closely with the USAF we helped bring back the A-2 Flight Jacket into military use in 1987, have supplied Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard Units, as well as many foreign Militaries. We have been fan favorites of Civilian Pilots, Air Show Performers, Military Pilots, Movie Stars, Sports Stars, and the function and fashion conscious who look for high quality outerwear, predominantly made in the USA. We strive to produce a quality garment that can last years and be passed down generations.",New York,15 West 39th Street,"Adobe Media Optimizer, Afterpay, Backbone JS Library, Bing Ads, Cedexis Radar, Criteo, Facebook Conversion Tracking, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Google Analytics, Google Font API, Google Tag Manager, Gorgias, Mailchimp Mandrill, Microsoft Office 365, Mobile Friendly, Outlook, Render, Shopify, Shopify Plus, Vimeo, Yotpo, YouTube, accessiBe, reCAPTCHA",,,https://twitter.com/CockpitUSAinc,http://www.cockpitusa.com,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQE__slDDlT1-Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1666810647781?e=1738195200&v=beta&t=57UadZUjDeKmbZqiAk22kFB0X2HZHws8KjpRIA6Gtl8,owner,,Owner,

We get to share in one of the most incredibly special memories ever to be made. What an honor to be part of that.

We are a proud family-owned business who is here to stand by you during your entire wedding buying process.  We smile with you, we clap with you and we cry with you.

First allow us to help you find the perfect wedding dress.  Once you are perfectly situated with your wedding dress, we then start helping your bridesmaid and flower girl - it's a lot of fun!  Then it's the guy's turn.  With over 70 styles of tuxedos and suits, groom, groomsmen, dads and ring bearer will certainly find exactly what you want for your wedding day.

We are proud to have won best of Bucks and Montgomery Counties and best of Bucks County as a bridal shop and men's formal wear as voted by the Intelligencer and Courier times readers  every year since opening in 2013.  We have also received the couples' choice award by WeddingWire and Pick of the the Knot.

We are accredited by the Better Business Bureau and are proud to serve you with integrity and an A+ rating by the BBB.

Our family, employees and community are very important to us.  We partner with wonderful causes such as Wish Upon A Wedding, Angel Gowns, St. Jude's, and Cinderella's Closet. We donate to the theater, band, and music programs of local schools, partner in many senior year events, and sponsor school and community athletic associations. Giving back is very important to us in our business and personal lives. In September 2015, we moved Darianna Bridal & Tuxedo to a new, larger location.  The name Darianna is a combination of the names of our two daughters, Daria and Deanna.

We would be honored to be a part of your special day and memories, too.

Petticoat Fair opened in 1964 on Guadalupe Street in Austin, TX. Owners Bob and Betty Andrews' concept was to provide service to all women in need of intimate apparel. As the business grew, Petticoat Fair moved to Highland Mall and eventually to Northcross Center, where it is located today. In 2022 Petticoat Fair opened a second location, formerly known as Loretta's Intimates in Plano, Texas.

The principles of bra fitting and customer service have remained the same since the store's opening: Every woman is treated with respect and given one-on-one attention to help her feel comfortable and confident in properly fitted undergarments. The techniques Betty learned in corsetiere school and other training courses are still used in the store today, which is now owned by their youngest son, Kirk Andrews.",Texas,7739 Northcross Dr,"Adobe Media Optimizer, Afterpay, Basis, Bootstrap Framework, Cedexis Radar, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Google AdWords Conversion, Google Analytics, Google Font API, Google Maps, Google Maps (Non Paid Users), Google Tag Manager, Mobile Friendly, Paypal, Sendgrid, Shopify, Shopify Product Reviews, TikTok, Vimeo, Yotpo",,,https://twitter.com/PetticoatFair,http://www.petticoatfair.com,,https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2,owner,Texas,Owner,

In their hand-selected antique rugs, you will find subtleties of culture, weave, tribal symbolism, materials and dyes. Versed in the subtleties of regional design, the staff explains the differences between weavings created near the mountains and those made close to the sea. Each of these details has a distinct impact on the materials, quality and fineness of Mehraban's antique rugs.

Mehraban pays extraordinary attention to their processes, which include hand washing, hand shearing, and other proprietary details, all of which play a critical part in the final product.",California,545 N La Cienega Blvd,"Circle, DoubleClick, DoubleClick Conversion, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Gmail, Google Apps, Google Dynamic Remarketing, Google Tag Manager, Klaviyo, Mobile Friendly, QuickBooks, Remote, Shopify, Vimeo, YouTube, reCAPTCHA",,,https://twitter.com/mehrabanrugs,http://www.mehraban.com,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQEG2shX7GBSMA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1517052652748?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Vs8Q5jjcUqczdnBg38A1TFwOB8jwN7p6EgGCXDG1JvU,owner,California,Owner,

Our Montana adventure began in 2022 with the goal of providing residents of the Great Falls area with the most reliable vehicles available, in an honest, welcoming and safe environment.

Jeremy and his family chose Great Falls and are committed to the community and the people. 

The unique setting of Great Falls Subaru at the corner of 8th and Central is steeped in Montana auto history as the former home of Bennett Motors. The showroom that still stands on our lot was built in 1948 and is on the registry of National Historic Places.

- Do you feel like you're doing everything possible, yet your VM doesn't value it?

- Are you suddenly receiving fewer POs than usual?

- Do your best sellers perform on other marketplaces but not on Amazon?

- Get unexpected trading terms increase every year?

(keep reading...)

I get it, as I've written the business logic powering some of the algorithms that run Amazon.

I've been on the other side as a VM and I know why Amazon decided to put automation in charge of their business and yours...


If you are looking after an Amazon account, and you're

❌ Tired of the algorithm suddenly turning on you

❌ Sick of feeling misunderstood and undervalued by Amazon

❌. Frustrated by a lack of reliable and predictable ways to scale your Amazon account

❌ Stressed that Amazon is making up excuses to penalize your business


I've got something that'll put an end to your misery, once and for all.

It's called the ""Amazon Decision Matrix""

It provides key points of understanding how you can make profitable decisions, systematically, that Amazon's algorithms reward

When you harness the ""Amazon Decision Matrix"" for your Amazon account, you will:

✅ see consistent and reliable revenue from the Amazon account

✅ experience first hand why Amazon is not an art, it's a predictable science

✅ be able to shape Amazon's automated decision making for your business

✅ understand what Amazon sees as blockers to your brand's growth and how to turn those around

✅ stop wondering if or when POs will come, start knowing

Start building a stronger, more profitable partnership with Amazon today.

We would like sell more franchises to other investors who are looking to own their own business but who just don't know what to do or how to go about it.  My advice to most folks who would like to own a business is to (first of all) consider franchises in general.  1) 95% of all small, independent businesses fail within 5 years.  90% of all franchise businesses succeed within the first 5 years of business.  So, if you are interested in owning your own business, give franchises a try.  Ours may or may not be right for you.

- Do you feel like you're doing everything possible, yet your VM doesn't value it?

- Are you suddenly receiving fewer POs than usual?

- Do your best sellers perform on other marketplaces but not on Amazon?

- Get unexpected trading terms increase every year?

(keep reading...)

I get it, as I've written the business logic powering some of the algorithms that run Amazon.

I've been on the other side as a VM and I know why Amazon decided to put automation in charge of their business and yours...


If you are looking after an Amazon account, and you're

❌ Tired of the algorithm suddenly turning on you

❌ Sick of feeling misunderstood and undervalued by Amazon

❌. Frustrated by a lack of reliable and predictable ways to scale your Amazon account

❌ Stressed that Amazon is making up excuses to penalize your business


I've got something that'll put an end to your misery, once and for all.

It's called the ""Amazon Decision Matrix""

It provides key points of understanding how you can make profitable decisions, systematically, that Amazon's algorithms reward

When you harness the ""Amazon Decision Matrix"" for your Amazon account, you will:

✅ see consistent and reliable revenue from the Amazon account

✅ experience first hand why Amazon is not an art, it's a predictable science

✅ be able to shape Amazon's automated decision making for your business

✅ understand what Amazon sees as blockers to your brand's growth and how to turn those around

✅ stop wondering if or when POs will come, start knowing

Start building a stronger, more profitable partnership with Amazon today.

Save your money on photocopier printer machine lease or rental. Tested and Inspected by Ex-Xerox Technicians. We can install homes and office printers within Sydney, or buyer can pick up.","The history of Copy Smart began when a friend who was a minister at an Anglican church asked me if I could help him source a cheap second hand photocopier. Knowing that I had worked with Fuji Xerox as a contractor for 5 years as a National Operations Manager, he could trust me to get the best possible deal on a copier for him. Well, I had left work with Fuji Xerox a few years earlier but I said that I would try to source one for him.

Unfortunately that took longer than he was able to wait, and he ended up purchasing an expensive second hand ""analogue"" Richo copier with very ""high copy count"" and a ""long term contract"" with a ""high click charge"" rate.

I hate it when people get ripped off. If someone tried to sell you a car, you would know what a reasonable make and price would be on that car, but when purchasing a second hand photocopier most people do not have the faintest idea.

In early 2016, that's precisely what we did. Nate began putting together small batches of natural ingredients to create an easy-to-use, water-based product that had incredible hold, with a natural feel and pliable texture – something that didn't really exist at the time. We'd love to say our first batch was flawless, and we launched our business the next day, but that's just not how life works. 

After the first few batches, it seemed as though Nate was better at making candles than he was at producing pomade … but he stuck with it. And a few months later, our Original Pomade was born. We had finally pioneered a new pomade that was everything we had been looking for. Once Nate's extensive research and formulating started to show promise, Christian hopped on board, and we made the jump from a small passion project to a full-fledged business. And in August of 2016, we released our first production batch of Ace High Original Pomade to the public.
In the early days, finding time for production was difficult, but we always had a blast because our passion for our products pushed us to stay motivated. Oftentimes, we would have to work during the wee hours of the night to utilize the commercial kitchen of our coffee shop. Our methods were definitely not ideal, but eventually we perfected the process. And with the help of a modified crockpot and many sleepless nights in the kitchen of our coffee shop, we produced the first 25 official jars of Ace High Original Pomade.
Since launching our Original Pomade, we've developed a full Ace High product line that includes Pomade, Beard Balm, Tonic, Shampoo and Conditioner. We've moved past the crockpot to an actual production space in our own red brick building with a rad staff dedicated to production and manufacturing.",Michigan,22016 Woodward Ave,"Basis, Data Analytics, Gmail, Google Apps, Remote, Render, Reviews",,,,http://www.acehighco.com,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQGrKSK31c1BMw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1580571840819?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=m6m-9sEUk5guLN2oOD3PvoFzcvdR_LbbqiescFnOcww,founder,Michigan,Co-Founder,

Jay had worked for his parents in the powersports and marine business for many years, and he visualized an offshoot of their company that would focus on motorcycles and dirt bikes, as well as other powersports vehicles like ATVs, UTVs, and snowmobiles. Little did he know that within a very short time, he would be outgrowing the modest store-front where he first set up Jay's Power Center.

Jay's passion for and knowledge of the powersports industry led to increased business, loyal customers, and the need for a new larger showroom space and an expanded service area. In 2016, Jay's Power Center held its Grand Opening in its current location on East Main Street in Reedsburg, Wisconsin.

A lot has changed for Jay and his team since that first little shop, but one thing hasn't: our mission to provide the best buying experience for our customers.

Our company, providing clients with lighting solutions since 1999, is committed to maintaining its deep-rooted family tradition. Owned by a trio of Monckton siblings who grew up in the great state of Kansas, all have lived the homebuilding lifestyle in one way or another since they were old enough to go to work — some would even say before that! Dad spent 40+ years in the building material industry, starting as a truck driver out of high school and winding up as VP running the show statewide. Everybody learned early on what taking care of homebuilders and their clients was all about. We owe all our success to the loyal customer base we've been so lucky to grow and serve through the years. So if you are just learning about us, please join us — but fair warning: our clients come back again and again.
 
You won't find a group of people more eager to be a part of your project in central Texas than Texas Bright Ideas.

The pair formed their alliance over a British puppy adopted by Davis while stationed in wartime England. After accomplishing a stateside transfer for the lucky pup, the two remained friends, joining forces in the pet food business. Davis passed away in the late ‘60s, but Cohen soldiered on with their enterprise through 1995, when the business was purchased by Barry Jacobson and his sons Adam and Ari, who run the business today.

 When the business was re-conceived in 1995, the large warehouse space which was home to the original Pet Pantry was converted into a more modern shopping experience and a new business model was born. 

 The success of the reformatted Greenwich location paved the way for additional locations in Rye, NY in 2006, Larchmont, NY, in 2010.  A fourth location in New Canaan, CT, opened in late 2012 along with another store in neighboring Wilton, CT. The options for a convenient local shopping experience have continued to grow with additional stores in Riverside, CT,  Scarsdale, NY and our 7th store located at 1876 Blackrock Turnpike in Fairfield, CT opened in the Summer of 2018. 

 As a local, family run business we understand the importance of giving back to the communities in which we operate.

Zane in 1980, at the age of 16. Since then, the store has grown from a local bicycle and hobby shop, to the largest P&I (Premiums and Incentives) distributor of bicycles in the United States.

The story of Zane's growth from small shop owner to major distributor found its way into several major business publications and college courses on marketing. Inc. and Fortune magazines both wrote positively of his aggressive local strategies, labeling them in some cases as ""guerrilla marketing"". An example was his tactic of purchasing competitor's phone numbers after putting them out of business.

In another quite opposite strategy, his focus on establishing a bond with the customer through simple gestures -- like selling children's helmets at dealer cost, and offering lifetime guarantees -- was a topic in an article by the Harvard Business Review.",Connecticut,330 E Main St,"AddThis, Adobe Coldfusion, Adobe Media Optimizer, Cedexis Radar, Google Analytics, Google Cloud Hosting, Google Font API, Google Tag Manager, Mobile Friendly, Nginx, Outlook, PowerReviews, Remote, Route 53, Vimeo, YouTube",,,https://twitter.com/zanescycles,http://www.zanes.com,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQF_GiHOnwHHTg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1517747747743?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=uG2auN6TbEwNN7FxqcgoNNQ8iYIWIbYtMEa2R1MmbKk,founder,Connecticut,Founder / President,

Paperclip's diaper bag changing stations are the solution for any parents on the go.","Welcome to Paperclip. Where innovation, sustainability and the family experience form the three pillars of everything we've believed in since 2017. 

OUR VISION
Take our groundbreaking diaper bags, for example. We weren't going to just go out there and make more of the same. Not a chance. From its iconic, patented and integrated changing station to its luxury design, Paperclip bags are a true game changer that both moms and dads can throw over their shoulders with confidence. But we didn't stop there.

The health and well-being of our planet is important to us, and we've taught our children about the impact of sustainability at an early age. And we're doing that by example. That's why all our products are made using recycled plastics from our oceans and rivers, fields and beaches. We're proud of the small part we play in making the planet a cleaner place for all our children, ours and yours. 

All this leads to the most important part of all - a better family experience. When parents are filled with confidence, have fewer things to worry about when it comes to the care of their children, and feel good about the product choices they make, they can spend more time enjoying the precious moments with their family. 

And we're just getting started. In 2024 you'll see new product innovations like sustainably made high chairs, feeding products that truly stimulate a child's five senses, and a brand-new line of diaper bags that will change the game all over again.",Arizona,3104 E Camelback Rd,"AI, Android, DoubleClick, DoubleClick Conversion, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Login (Connect), Facebook Widget, Flutter, Gmail, Google AdWords Conversion, Google Analytics, Google Apps, Google Dynamic Remarketing, Google Font API, Google Tag Manager, IoT, Klaviyo, Linkshare, Mobile Friendly, Python, Reviews, SharePoint, Shopify, Vimeo, reCAPTCHA",,,,http://www.papercliplife.com,cornwell.ben@gmail.com,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQG-hRlh0D97ig/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1517546408102?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LHcTT_IcX-JXU5R7QR9hzMpyb0fcOupnhvGm6lF-m0g,founder,California,Co-Founder and Partner,https://twitter.com/themfcoeo

What we do
We design and decorate personalized gifts for life's happy moments, and ship quickly to customers across the US (most gifts are out our door within 2 business days). So whether you need the perfect gift for your mom on Mother's Day or something unique for your entire wedding party, we've got you covered. We also work with companies and brands who need gifts and promotional items with their custom logos.  

How we do it
Our gifts are all designed and decorated by our team with laser engraving, embroidery, or sublimation. Every single gift we ship is inspected by two of our team members to ensure we meet the highest quality standards. Our general rule of thumb: If you wouldn't be proud to give the gift to an important person in your life, it doesn't pass our quality inspection. We prioritize great customer service (be sure to Google us and our reviews) so you can be assured you'll get your questions answered or help if needed.

Where we are
We're based out of Merrillville, Indiana, about 45 minutes outside of Chicago.

Who we are
In 2007, Lifetime Creations officially got its start when Nick and his mom, Pat, purchased our original laser engraver. Over the next few years, Nick worked on the business part-time doing lots of custom projects and craft shows.

After Nick and Stephanie got engaged and started planning their own wedding in 2011, they realized there was a need for high quality, personalized wedding gifts and they launched our Etsy shop. They continued to do craft shows while our ecommerce business grew.

A few years later, Stephanie joined the business full time and we shortly hired our first part-time employee.

Visit the Nina Berenato Bracelet Bar inside the store to get zapped with your own custom welded permanent bracelet.","After over 10 years in the jewelry business, each piece of Nina Berenato's collection still touches the designer's hands. From her humble beginnings as a metalsmith's apprentice in Brooklyn to gracing the pages of Vogue, W, Cosmopolitan, MTV and outfitting fashion-forward celebrities like Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Lena Dunham, FKA Twigs and Lizzo, it's obvious that Nina walks through life with her eyes open, bringing a one of a kind vision to each design.

A large part of Nina Berenato's brand identity rests on the designer's goal to use her gift for design to make all women feel powerful, beautiful and capable of anything. Each piece is cast using 100% recycled metal, finished in the highest quality 14k gold plating, and set with stones that are sourced and mined ethically.

In 2018 Nina opened her flagship store now at 3200 Palm Way #152 at Domain NORTHSIDE where she produces her namesake collection, teaches jewelry making classes and leads her team of 5 incredible Austin women.

Joe and Sid were pioneers in the Retail market of pipes and tobaccos, and established a real Specialty Tobacco shop.  From 1940 until the late 1970's, Smokers' Haven was one of the largest and most distinguished Pipe and Tobacco shops in the world with an inventory of over 10,000 English pipes and a range of some of the best Pipe Tobacco Blends.  Joe and Sid would take frequent trips to England to develop new tobacco blends and new shapes for GBD pipes so they could offer unique and quality products for their customer base which numbered over 60,000.  In the late 1970's and early 1980's, the pipe market started to dwindle and many of the pipe and tobacco suppliers discontinued their products.  In 1983, Joe Zieve retired and sold Smokers' Haven.  The 2nd owner did not adapt to the market, and Smokers' Haven almost disappeared.  In 1987, my father Arvind Chheda, purchased Smokers' Haven and rescued it from demise.  Throughout the late 1980's and 1990's Cigars were the primary focus for Smokers' Haven.  In 1999, I was passed the torch, and  I have taken an interest in Pipes, and the methods in which Joseph Zieve serviced his customers.

Our founder Karen's Mom had become very ill from cancer and pulmonary fibrosis. It was Christmas Eve and Karen's mom told her she no longer wanted to receive visitors as she felt she looked too bad in her state of illness. It broke Karen's heart to see how her mother had lost her dignity.  Karen decided that she was going to make her feel special and pretty on Christmas day.  She made her a wrap that could go over her hospital gown and put a pretty flower pin on it (she loved flowers and gardening).  Karen put a little bit of lipstick on her and gave her some rosy cheeks, and Karen saw her mother's familiar smile come back.  

That day inspired Karen for the rest of her life. Karen saw that helping someone feel and look special despite their illness could really make an impact on a patient's outlook and dignity.  That day Karen was inspired to create Wrapped in Love, a clothing and accessory line for women with cancer and other illnesses, to provide them with comfort, style and dignity, despite illness.

Behind every Wrapped in Love creation is a whole lot of care and core values that we never compromise on.

~Having cancer doesn't mean giving up your sense of style. 
~Chemo clothes should be designed with the patient in mind — but still be practical for healthcare workers.
~Made in the USA with love because you deserve the best.
